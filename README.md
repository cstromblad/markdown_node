# Naive Obsidian Markdown Nodenetwork something something

This "tool" was created because I had an idea about building some sort of naive Graph network in Python and spit out it as a Markdown representation to be used within Obsidian.

# Installation

Ha, as if. There's no installation. Clone the repo, that's it.

# Usage

Well, have a look at the client.py file to see how I've implemented it. And if you want to generate the network you do this:

`$ uv run client.py`

This will output the data into `data/test-network` and that's it. Enjoy!
